Pirate Dice: Voyage on the Rolling Seas,124047,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,,I love RoboRally. This has RoboRally guts but is significantly less fun. The 5x5 boards compact the play area too much. The boards have too many elements. Only having 6 dice is too limiting. Getting locked in on moves after taking a second point of damage is too punishing. Rules are poorly written. The ghost ship is a really fun idea but it is too strong since it switches boards to follow you and fires after every bell. It makes it impossible to lower sails and recover damage if you have the treasure since you opponents will use it to destroy you. The most redeeming quality is skulduggery. This game needs a major rules overhaul to be enjoyable.

An incredible economic game. The theme and mechanisms really come together in this game. I love the way that players are forced to cooperate but also that you can completely screw over other players by moving their oil somewhere they didn't want it to be, or forcing them to purchase oil from you.
